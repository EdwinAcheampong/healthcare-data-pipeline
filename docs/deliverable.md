# Risk Management and Mitigation

## 7.1 Technical Risks

### Model Performance Risk

- **Risk:** ML models may not achieve target accuracy
- **Mitigation:** Multiple model architectures, extensive hyperparameter tuning, fallback to simpler models if needed

### Integration Complexity

- **Risk:** Difficulty integrating with existing healthcare systems
- **Mitigation:** Focus on standard APIs, containerized deployment, phased integration approach

## 7.2 Data and Compliance Risks

### Data Access Limitations

- **Risk:** Unable to access real NHS data due to regulatory barriers
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive synthetic data approach, public dataset utilization, anonymized data partnerships

### Regulatory Compliance

- **Risk:** Inadvertent violation of healthcare regulations
- **Mitigation:** Early consultation with compliance experts, conservative approach to data handling, comprehensive audit trails

## 7.3 Project Management Risks

### Scope Creep

- **Risk:** Project becomes too complex to complete in timeframe
- **Mitigation:** Clear milestone definitions, regular scope reviews, focus on core objectives

### Technical Dependencies

- **Risk:** Reliance on external systems and APIs
- **Mitigation:** Multiple backup options, offline development capabilities, modular architecture
